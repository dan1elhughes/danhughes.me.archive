		<h2>who I am</h2>
		I'm a young student web developer hoping to make some awesome stuff. I occasionally <a href="https://www.facebook.com/danhughesmusic">DJ</a> at events. I play double bass and bass guitar as a <a href="<?php echo $rootpath;?>sessionmusician/">session musician</a>, and piano in my spare time.
		<h2>what I do</h2>
		My current focus is PHP, HTML and CSS. At the moment I'm trying to improve my knowledge of Javascript, and I have some basic knowledge of VB.net. I mainly do database type projects, with a bit of design for good measure.
		<h2>where I do it</h2>
		Right now I'm at Highdown School in Reading, hopefully heading to University of Reading in October 2013 to study computer science.
